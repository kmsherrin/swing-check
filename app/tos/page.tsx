              Services and that you upload to the Services (collectively, "Your
              Data"). The Receiving Party agrees: (i) to take reasonable
              precautions to protect such Proprietary Information, and (ii) not
              to use (except in performance of the Services or as otherwise

              illegal activities, malware, malicious files or content, viruses
              and the like and for no other purpose. Otherwise, Swing Check will
              not sell, disclose, or share any Your Data (or any part or product
              thereof) with anyone else. Swing Check will implement and maintain
              reasonable information security policies and processes (including

              available by Swing Check ("Feedback"), you hereby grant Swing
              Check a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free,
              fully-paid-up, fully transferable, worldwide license (with rights
              to sublicense through multiple tiers of sublicenses) under all of
              your intellectual property rights, for Swing Check to use and
              exploit in any manner and for any purpose. 15.5. Aggregate Data.
              Swing Check shall have the right to collect and analyze data and
              other information relating to the provision, use and performance
              of various aspects of the Services and related systems and
              technologies (excluding Your Data and data derived therefrom), and
              Swing Check will be free (during and after the term hereof) to (i)
              use such information and data to improve and enhance the Services
              and for other development, diagnostic and corrective purposes in
              connection with the Services and other Swing Check offerings, and
              (ii) disclose such data solely in aggregate or other de-identified
              form in connection with its business. 15.6. Customer Name. During
              the term of this Agreement, you grant Swing Check a non-exclusive,
              royalty-free, fully-paid up license to use and reproduce your
              trademarks, tradenames and logos in Swing Check's marketing
              materials and website(s) and to indicate that you are a Swing
              Check customer. Swing Check will abide by any written trademark
              usage guidelines provided by you. All goodwill arising out of the
              use of your trademarks, tradenames and logos shall inure to your
              benefit. **16**. Payment of Fees. 16.1. Purchasing of Minutes. The
              Services will be provided so as long an account has a credited
              amount of minutes. There are 'free' minutes and there are
              purchasable 'minute' plans. For an enterprise license, you must
              contact Shot Check separately. You may opt to upgrade or downgrade
              to any other plan level that Swing Check offers at any time during
              the period of your plan; provided that a downgrade will not be
              effective until the next renewal date. FFees will be billed to the
              credit card or other payment account you provide in accordance
              with the billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is
              due and payable. You acknowledge and agree that Swing Check will
              automatically charge your credit card or other payment account on
              record with Swing Check in connection with your use of the
              Services: in advance of each self-service subscription term, for
              the self-service subscription you have selected and any additional
              Services added to your self-service subscription. The self-service
              subscription and any additional Services added to your
              self-service subscription will automatically-renew for the same
              term as the initial term. You represent and warrant to Swing Check
              that all of your payment information is true and that you are
              authorized to use the payment instrument. You will promptly update
              your account information with any changes (for example, a change
              in your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may
              occur. If payment is not received or cannot be charged to your
              credit card or other payment account for any reason in advance,
              Swing Check reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your
              access to the Services and terminate this Agreement. All fees are
              non-refundable, except as expressly stated otherwise in this
              Agreement. 16.2. Payments. All payments shall be made in the
              currency of, and within the borders of the United States. You will
              pay all applicable taxes, duties, withholdings, backup withholding
              and the like; when Swing Check has the legal obligation to pay or
              collect such taxes, the appropriate amount shall be paid by you
              directly to Swing Check. If all or any part of any payment owed to
              Swing Check under this Agreement is withheld, based upon a claim
              that such withholding is required pursuant to the tax laws of any
              country or its political subdivisions and/or any tax treaty
              between the U.S. and any such country, such payment shall be
              increased by the amount necessary to result in a net payment to
              Swing Check of the amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement.
              You will reimburse Swing Check any pre-approved and agreed upon
              costs. Swing Check may change its fees and payment terms at its
              discretion; provided however, that such changes will not take
              effect for you until the start of the next payment period. Shot
              Check will provide written notice to you for any changes to the
              fees that affect the Services purchased by you. Your continued use
              of the Services after the price change becomes effective
              constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount. **17**. Term
              and Termination. 17.1. Term. Subject to earlier termination as
              provided below, the term of this Agreement will commence on your
              acceptance of this Agreement and will continue for as long as the
              Services are being provided to you under this Agreement. You have
              the right to terminate your account at any time by sending a
              cancellation request to Swing Check Support via{" "}
              <a
                href="mailto:support@shot-check.follow-through-labs.online"
                type="email"
              >
                support@shot-check
              </a>
              . Such termination will be effective at the start of the next
              renewal period. Subject to earlier termination as provided below,
              Swing Check may terminate your account and this Agreement at any
              time by providing thirty (30) days prior notice to the
              administrative email address associated with your account. In
              addition to any other remedies Swing Check may have, Swing Check
              may also terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days' notice (or
              two (2) days in the case of nonpayment), if you breach any of the
              terms or conditions of this Agreement. Swing Check may terminate
              your account and this Agreement immediately if you exceed any Shot
              Check limits concerning use of the Services, including without
              limitation, the maximum period of time that data, code or other
              content will be retained by the Services, the maximum storage
              space that will be allotted on Swing Check's servers on your
              behalf, and the maximum compute capacity provided for the
              execution of builds and functions and the maximum network data
              transferred by the Services. You acknowledge that Swing Check
              reserves the right to terminate accounts that are inactive for an
              extended period of time and the right to modify or discontinue,
              temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof).
              All of Your Content on the Services (if any) may be permanently
              deleted by Swing Check upon any termination of your account in its
              sole discretion. If Swing Check terminates your account without
              cause and you have signed up for a self-service subscription, Shot
              Check will refund the pro-rated, unearned portion of any amount
              that you have prepaid to Swing Check for such Services. Upon
              termination, if requested by you within fourteen (14) days of the
              effective termination date. 17.2. Survival. All sections of this
              Agreement which by their nature should survive termination will
              survive termination, including, without limitation, Sections 16.1
              and 16.2, and accrued rights to payment, confidentiality
              obligations, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.
              17.3. Effect of Termination. Upon the termination of this
              Agreement for any reason: (i) the licenses granted under this
              Agreement in respect of the Services shall immediately terminate
              and you and your users shall cease use of the Services; (ii) Shot
              Check will cease providing any Support Services; (iii) you shall
              pay to Swing Check the full amount of any outstanding fees due
              hereunder; and (iv) within fourteen (14) calendar days of such
              termination, each party shall destroy or return all Proprietary
              Information of the other party in its possession or control, and
              will not make or retain any copies of such information in any
              form, except that the receiving party may retain one (1) archival
              copy of such information solely for purposes of ensuring
              compliance with this Agreement. **18**. Disclaimer. THE SERVICES
              AND SUPPORT SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND Swing Check
              DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
              LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
              A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Swing Check DOES NOT
              WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES OR DELIVERABLES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR
              ERROR FREE; NOR DOES IT MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE RESULTS THAT
              MAY BE OBTAINED FROM USE OF THE SERVICES OR DELIVERABLES. **19**.
              Limitation of Liability. 19.1. Limit of Liability and Waiver of
              Consequential Damages. EXCEPT FOR YOUR BREACH OF SECTIONS 10, 15,
              AND 16, OR YOUR BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OR
              YOUR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS, NEITHER PARTY NOR ITS SUPPLIERS
              (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ALL EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY
              SUPPLIERS), OFFICERS, AFFILIATES, REPRESENTATIVES, CONTRACTORS AND
              EMPLOYEES SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY
              SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATED
              THERETO UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER
              THEORY: (A) FOR ERROR OR INTERRUPTION OF USE OR FOR LOSS OR
              INACCURACY OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR COST OF PROCUREMENT OF
              SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY OR LOSS OF BUSINESS; (B)
              FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR
              PUNITIVE DAMAGES; OR (C) FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES, COSTS, LOSSES, OF
              LIABILITIES IN AMOUNTS THAT, TOGETHER WITH AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH
              ALL OTHER CLAIMS, EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND
              THE FEES PAID BY YOU TO Swing Check FOR THE SERVICES UNDER THIS
              AGREEMENT IN THE 6 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACT THAT GAVE RISE TO THE
              LIABILITY, IN EACH CASE, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN
              ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
              SECTION ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE
              PARTIES, AND THE PARTIES HAVE RELIED ON THESE LIMITATIONS IN
              DETERMINING WHETHER TO ENTER THIS AGREEMENT. 19.2. Limits. Some
              states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or
              limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages,
              which means that some of the above limitations may not apply to
              you. IN THESE STATES, Swing Check'S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO
              THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. **20**. Miscellaneous. Swing
              Check may change this Agreement from time to time by providing
              notice either by emailing the email address associated with your
              account or by posting a notice at{" "}
              <a href="https://shot-check.follow-through-labs.online/tos">
                https://shot-check.follow-through-labs.online/tos
              </a>
              . You can review the most current version of this Agreement at any
              time at{" "}
              <a href="https://shot-check.follow-through-labs.online/tos">
                https://shot-check.follow-through-labs.online/tos
              </a>
              . The revised Agreement will become effective immediately after
              Swing Check posts or sends you notice of such changes, and if you
              use the Services after that date, your use will constitute
              acceptance of the revised Agreement. If any change to this
              Agreement is not acceptable to you, your only remedy is to stop
              using the Services and send a cancellation email to Swing Check
              Support via the Support Center. If any provision of this Agreement
              is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be
              limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this
              Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and
              enforceable. You may not assign, transfer or sublicense without
              the prior written consent of Swing Check, but Swing Check may
              assign or transfer this Agreement, in whole or in part, without
              restriction. Any attempted assignment or transfer of this
              Agreement by the parties in contravention of the foregoing shall
              be null and void. This Agreement is the complete and exclusive
              statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and
              supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements,
              communications and other understandings relating to the subject
              matter of this Agreement, and that all amendments must be in
              writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided
              herein. Swing Check's failure to exercise or enforce any right or
              provision of this Agreement shall not be a waiver of that right.
              No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as
              a result of this Agreement and neither party has any authority of
              any kind to bind the other party in any respect whatsoever. In any
              action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the
              prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys'
              fees. All notices under this Agreement will be in writing and will
              be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally
              delivered; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if
              transmitted by email; the day after it is sent, if sent for next
              day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service; and upon
              receipt, if sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt
              requested. Any delays in or failure of performance of Swing Check
              shall not constitute a default hereunder or give rise to any
              claims for damages if, to the extent that, and for such period
              that, such delays or failures of performance are caused by any
              events beyond the reasonable control of Swing Check including,
              without limitation, any of the following specific occurrences:
              acts of God or the public enemy, acts of terrorism, pandemics,
              epidemics, labor strikes, expropriation or confiscation of
              facilities, compliance with any unanticipated duly promulgated
              governmental order, acts of war, rebellion or sabotage or damage
              resulting therefrom, fires, floods, explosion, or riots.
              {/* **21**. Governing Law; Disputes; Arbitration.
21.1. Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
21.2. Binding Contract. You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you and Swing Check, even though it may be electronic and may not be physically signed by you and Swing Check, and it governs your use of the Services.
21.3. Exclusive Jurisdiction and Venue; Arbitration.
21.3.1 Disputes with a Domestic Customer. If you are located and headquartered in the United States of America, you and Swing Check each irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in the San Francisco County, California for all proceedings arising out of this contract or related to the parties’ relationship, and you and Swing Check agree to only institute such proceedings in those courts. You and Swing Check also waive any objection to venue in those courts based on improper venue. You and Swing Check agree that a final judgment (subject to appeals) in any such proceeding is conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in another lawful manner.
21.3.2. Disputes with a Foreign Customer. If you are located and headquartered outside of the United States of America, then any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law. Any dispute between you and Swing Check that is not resolved through negotiation will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration conducted in accordance with the then-current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS"). The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator selected by agreement of you and Swing Check or, if you and Swing Check cannot agree, an arbitrator appointed in accordance with the JAMS rules who shall be experienced in the type of dispute at issue. You and Swing Check, their representatives, the arbitrator, and other participants shall keep confidential the existence, content, and result of the arbitration. Any demand for arbitration and any counterclaim must specify in reasonable detail the facts and legal grounds forming the basis for the claimant’s claims and include a statement of the total amount of damages claimed, if any, and any other remedy sought by the claimant. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language; the location of such arbitration shall be in San Francisco, California. Each party will bear its own costs in the arbitration. The arbitrator will have full power and authority to determine issues of arbitrability and to interpret or construe the provisions of the agreement documents and to fashion appropriate remedies (including temporary, preliminary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief); provided that the arbitrator will not have any right or authority: (i) in excess of the authority that a court having jurisdiction over the parties and the dispute would have absent this arbitration agreement; or (ii) to award damages in excess of the types and limitation of damages found in the Agreement. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the agreement to arbitrate, each party may apply at any time to a court of competent jurisdiction for appropriate injunctive relief or for other interim or conservatory measures, and by doing so will not breach or waive the agreement to arbitrate or impair the powers of the arbitrator. */}

              offer preview services from time to time. These services are
              provided "AS-IS", "WITH ALL FAULTS", and "AS AVAILABLE". Shot
